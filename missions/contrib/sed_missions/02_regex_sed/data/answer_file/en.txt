Dear father,

I am writing this letter in the hope that it reaches you safe and sound. As you may already know, I am currently held captive by a formidable dragon. However, I have discovered crucial information that could help us retrieve both the dragon's treasure and free me from its captivity.

Firstly, the dragon's treasure is located in a deep cave at the foot of the Eastern mountain, about a day's journey from the castle. To access it safely, one must traverse a narrow path through the woods and then follow the tracks left by wild animals that seem to avoid the area around the cave.

As for the dragon itself, it is powerful and vigilant, but I have noticed it has a weakness. Its Achilles' heel, if you'll allow me the expression, lies in its love for riddles and puzzles. It appears to take great pride in its intelligence and ability to pose unsolvable riddles. I firmly believe that if you manage to successfully challenge it in a game of wit or solve one of its riddles, you will earn its respect and perhaps even its alliance to free me.

I implore you not to risk the lives of our precious soldiers in a reckless frontal attack. Cunning and diplomacy may prove far more effective in this delicate situation.

I beseech you to come and save me, my dear father. My thoughts are constantly with you, and I hope to see you soon, free and safe.

Your devoted daughter,
The princess
