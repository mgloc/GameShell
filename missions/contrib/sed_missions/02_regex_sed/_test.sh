# This file is not required: it is sourced by the command "gsh test" for
# testing during development.
# If you write this file, rename it to 'test.sh'
#
# You can use some special commands
# gsh assert check true
# gsh assert check false
# gsh assert CONDITION
# to check that specific conditions are satisfied.
#
# Since it is sourced, it may define environment variables if you really need
# them, but it should "unset" any local variable it has created.
